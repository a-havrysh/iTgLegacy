//
// TGCall - one voice call.
//
// TDLib does the signalling: it negotiates the call, hands over the reflector
// servers and a 256-byte encryption key, and reports the other side hanging
// up. It carries no audio. The media is libtgvoip, vendored in src/libtgvoip -
// the same library the official client used when it brought calls to an
// iPhone 4S in 2017, which is why this works on this hardware at all.
//
// Built without the WebRTC DSP, so there is no echo cancellation: on speaker
// the other side hears themselves. The earpiece is fine.
//
