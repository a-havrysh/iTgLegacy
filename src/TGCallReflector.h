// TGCallReflector - the UDP link to a Telegram call reflector.

// The reflector is not a TURN server, whatever the surrounding WebRTC code in
// tgcalls suggests: ReflectorPort.cpp writes plain UDP with a small header.
// Every packet starts with a 16-byte peer tag - twelve bytes handed out by
// TDLib, then four that identify one side of the call - and the two ends find
// each other by that tag alone.
