// TGClient - TDLib client for iOS 7.1.2 / armv7.
//
// TDLib is loaded with dlopen rather than linked: statically linked it pushes
// the app's __TEXT past the 16MB armv7 thumb branch limit, which this linker
// cannot bridge. See scripts/build_tdlib_dylib.sh.
//
// Everything is JSON over td_json_client_*. One background thread owns the
// receive loop; handlers are always delivered on the main queue.
