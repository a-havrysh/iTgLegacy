// TGCallStun - the ICE connectivity checks a call needs, and nothing else.

// Two agents that want to send each other media first prove they can, by
// exchanging STUN binding requests signed with the credentials they swapped
// over the signalling channel. WebRTC does this with a full ICE agent; a call
// with one candidate pair needs the two messages below and no more.

// RFC 5389 for the framing, RFC 8445 for the ICE attributes.
